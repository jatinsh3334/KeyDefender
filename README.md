# Ethical Perspective & Deep Dive into Keylogger Development  

**Keyloggers pose a significant security threat by stealthily recording keystrokes, potentially compromising sensitive information.**  
This project not only demonstrates how a keylogger operates but also provides a robust detection mechanism to counter them.  
The problem of unauthorized keystroke logging is **universal**, affecting various operating systems, but the solution presented here is specifically designed for **Linux-based systems**.  
By leveraging **real-time monitoring** of `/dev/input/eventX` access and **suspicious file-writing activity**, this project offers an effective method to identify potential keyloggers running on a Linux machine.


## Ethical Usage of Keyloggers  
Keyloggers are powerful tools that can be used for both **legitimate** and **malicious** purposes. Ethical developers and security researchers leverage them to:  
‚úÖ **Test System Security** ‚Äì Simulating real-world attacks to strengthen system defenses.  
‚úÖ **Parental Control & Monitoring** ‚Äì Tracking device activity responsibly.  
‚úÖ **Corporate IT Security Audits** ‚Äì Ensuring employees adhere to security policies.  
‚úÖ **Forensic Investigations** ‚Äì Recovering lost data or analyzing security breaches.

# How the Keylogger Was Built  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Capturing Keystrokes** ‚Äì The keylogger directly reads keystrokes from `/dev/input/eventX`, which registers every keypress event on Linux.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Stealth Mode** ‚Äì Runs in the background, without visible UI, making detection harder.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Auto-Start on Boot** ‚Äì A system service (`.service` file) ensures the keylogger persists after reboot.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Hidden Storage** ‚Äì Logs keystrokes in `/var/tmp/.hidden_keylog/` to avoid easy detection.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Minimal System Impact** ‚Äì Uses lightweight system calls to avoid high resource usage.  

---  

# How the Detection System Works  
This detection system is divided into **two C++ files** for a better user experience:  
- üõ°Ô∏è **`key_detector_main.cpp`** ‚Äì Detects both log-writing and `/dev/input` access in a single process.  
- üîç **`secondary_detector.cpp`** ‚Äì Separates the detection into two steps:  
  - Processes accessing `/dev/input/eventX`  
  - Processes writing logs (without accessing input events)  
  
## Detection Mechanisms  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Real-Time File Write Tracking** ‚Äì Monitors processes writing to suspicious locations (`/var/log`, `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scanning for /dev/input Access** ‚Äì Flags processes reading keyboard events.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Dynamic Scanning & Process Matching** ‚Äì Ensures only real keyloggers are detected.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Background Monitoring** ‚Äì Runs continuously, requiring no manual intervention.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Blacklist Avoidance** ‚Äì Excludes legitimate system processes to prevent false positives.

# Setup & Installation Guide  
## Cloning the Repository  
```sh  
git clone https://github.com/jatinsh3334/KeyDefender 
cd KeyDefender
```  

## Setting Up the Keylogger  
### Compiling & Running the Keylogger  
```sh  
g++ keylogger_code.cpp -o keylogger_code  
sudo ./keylogger_code  
```  

### Check if logs are recorded correctly  
```sh  
cat /var/tmp/.hidden_keylog/keylog.txt  
```  

## Setting the Keylogger to Run on Boot  
### Copy the Service File to systemd Directory  
```sh  
sudo cp keylogger_code.service /etc/systemd/system/  
```  

### Enable and Start the Service  
```sh  
sudo systemctl enable keylogger_code.service  
sudo systemctl start keylogger_code.service  
```  

### To Disable the Service (if needed)  
```sh  
sudo systemctl disable keylogger_code.service  
```  

### Check the Status of Service  
```sh  
sudo systemctl status keylogger_code.service  
```  

## Setting Up the Keylogger Detection System  
### Compile & Run the Keylogger Detector  
```sh  
g++ key_detector_main.cpp -o key_detector_main  
./key_detector_main  
```  

### Running the Secondary Detector (Optional)  
```sh  
g++ secondary_detector.cpp -o secondary_detector  
./secondary_detector  
```  

### Interpret the Output  
- If a process accessing `/dev/input/eventX` **AND** writing logs is found ‚Üí **Likely a keylogger.**  
- If a process **only** accesses `/dev/input` ‚Üí Could be a legitimate system process or spyware.  
- If a process **only** writes logs ‚Üí Could be normal logging activity or a custom logging tool.

üìå **AI-Based Anomaly Detection** ‚Äì Use ML to distinguish between legit and malicious loggers.  
üìå **Real-time GUI Dashboard** ‚Äì Create a UI for detection results.  
üìå **Cross-Platform Support** ‚Äì Extend support to macOS and Windows.
